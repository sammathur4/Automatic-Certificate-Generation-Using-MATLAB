# Automatic-Certificate-Generation-Using-MATLAB

The Automatic Certificate Generation project overview is shown in Fig. 1. File name of the blank certificate (A) is used as input in the code. Details to be written on the certificate are obtained from an Excel sheet (B). The data is written over the blank certificate and many such certificates are generated by the MATLAB code (C). The certificates generated by the program can be saved in a folder with a unique file name (D).
